    You can use this file as a starting point for any HTML page that you want to
    create.
    
    This is a comment. Comments will not be displayed in the browser. A comment 
    can go over one or multiple lines.

    Use the !DOCTYPE declaration to explicitly tell the browser receiving this 
    file that it is an HMTL file. A DOCTYPE associates a particular document
    with a document type definition (DTD), for example, the formal definition of
    a particular version of HTML 2.0 - 4.0. The HTML layout engines in modern 
    web browsers perform DOCTYPE "sniffing" or "switching", wherein the DOCTYPE 
    in a document determines a layout mode, such as "quirks mode" (for 
    compatibility) or "standards mode" (for compliance with current standards). 
    The DOCTYPE is retained in HTML5 as a "mostly useless, but required" header 
    only to trigger "standards mode" in common browsers.
-->
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<!--
    After the DOCTYPE, the html document begins as is indicated by the html 
    root element. You can think of your entire html document as a tree and 
    the html element as the root from which everything else sprouts.
    
    The language attribute is used by web search engines to display search 
    results in a particular language. E.g. if you are using Google in the US, 
    you will not see many French pages returned in your results.

    <!--
        You could apply CSS styles in-line, i.e., in your HTML files, as follows:

        <style>
            p{color:red;}
        </style>

        This style would turn all font in paragraphs red. Generally, it is a 
        good idea to use a dedicated Style Sheet to have all styles 
        systematically in one place and not duplicate those. Include a link as 
        below in any HTML page where you want to use styles from your Style 
        Sheet.

        You can have multiple Style Sheets; the browser would use all.

        Just as CSS styles, you can also include JavaScript code in-line in your
        HTML files using the <script> and </script? opening and closing tags.
        Place CSS styles/links in the header and JavaScript code/links before the 
        closing </body> tag. The reason for having Style Sheets in the header is
        that otherwise browsers would need to reflow the layout while the user 
        is trying to interact with the page. If you would not have JavaScript 
        at the end, browsers in some cases would have to block processing 
        the HTML while JavaScript code is still being loaded.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style_sample.css">
</head>
 
<!--
    The body holds all content that is visible to the user and it determines 
    the structure of your page.
-->
<body>
    <!-- 
        Everything between two tags, including the tags, is an element. Headings
        come in six different sizes: <h1></h1> to <h6></h6>. Note that 
        it is not possible to autonumber headings in HTML. You would need to 
        write such functionality yourself.
     -->
    <h1>HTML and CSS Samples</h1>
    <h2>1. Basics</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <!--
        The <br> tag will cause a line break. It is self-closing.
    -->
    <p>This is paragraph<br>with a line break.</p>
    <hr><p>This is paragraph with a horizontal rule on top.</p>
    <!--
        Additional items, such as style below, are attributes of an elment. The
        style code is our first example of CSS and how we can use it together 
        with HTML. We can also use style outside of the p tags, in which case it 
        would apply to the whole site.
    -->
    <p style="background:lightblue;">And here is another paragraph with 
        CSS background styling.</p>
    <!--
        You can style your site without using CSS just with HTML. Here are some 
        examples.
    -->
    <small>Small text.</small><br>
    <mark>Marked text.</mark><br>
    <del>Crossed out text.</del><br>
    A <sub>subscript</sub><br>
    A <sup>superscript</sup><br>
    <!-- 
        Underlined text may be confused with links. So, use it sparingly.
    -->
    <u>Underlined text.</u><br>
    <i>Text in italics.</i><br>
    <!--
        Note the difference between the strong and bold tags. They look the 
        same but have different meaning.
    -->
    <b>Bold text is just a style.</b><br>
    <strong>Strong text means that the content here is important.</strong>
    <br>
    For example, screen readers for the visually impaired will pick up on this 
    distinction.<br>
    Using quote tags to show<q>quoted text.</q><br>
    "You can also use the quote characters, though, they
    will will not be recognized by the browser as quotes."<br>
    <blockquote>For longer text you can use blockquotes,
        which will be indented.</blockquote>
    <!--
        Just as for the bold and strong tags, italics and cited text looks 
        the same but have a different meaning when browsers and search 
        engines enounter it.
    -->
    <cite>Cited text.</cite>
    <h2>2. Character Entity References</h2>
    <p>
        Certain characters cannot be directly displayed in HTML because they are 
        part of the language. But you can use, for example,<br> 
        <span>&</span><span>gt</span><span>;</span>to display the &gt; sign,<br>
        <span>&</span><span>lt</span><span>;</span> for the &lt; sign, and<br>
        <span>&</span><span>amp</span><span>;</span> for the &amp; sign.<br>
        Enclosing the signs in &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags also works.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Divs</h2>
    <!--
        divs and spans are important fundamental tags for grouping HTML 
        content together. A span works in-line and is often used for a small
        chunk of HTML inside a line, e.g., part of a paragraph. A div (from 
        division) works block-line and causes a line break before and after 
        it. It is used to group larger chunks of HTML.
    -->
    <div>Here is a div (divison) with styling from our Style Sheet.</div>
    And here we have <span>a span</span>.<br>
    Note, this text is not blue because it is not within paragraph tags.
    <!--
        Both divs and spans are natural entry points for styling your page 
        with CSS.
    -->
    Here is a <span style=color:red;> span with inline styling</span>. In
    the following each of the lines is enclosed in its own div.
    <div>If I have multiple elements,</div>
    <div>and I want to style them in the same way,</div>
    <div>it is easier to use a Style Sheet.</div>
    <div>I can just update the style there once, and it will be reflected 
        everywhere where it is applied.</div>
    <div>If you want, you can use one div wrapping all your visible page 
        content and style in it to have a maxmium width to make the page 
        content look a bit more aligned and apply a particular style to 
        all of your page content.</div>
    <h3>3.1 Using the ID Attribute</h3>
    <div id="white-div">divs and other tags can have ids,
            which I can reference in the Style Sheet.
            ids have to be unique. They are intended to 
            unambigously identify one element. This is one 
            way to apply a different style to an element that
            has a generally defined style in the Style Sheet.
    </div>
    <h3>3.2 Using the Class Attribute</h3>
    <!--
        You can use the class attribute to style elements
        on your site that are not unique.
    -->
    <p class="color-class">
        This paragraph demonstrates the usage of the class attribute. Every 
        element of the background image class has white font.
    </p>
    <p class="background-image-class">
        You can include background images on your site.<br>
        Just as with any image or other resource, you<br>
        can load it from your own server or by giving<br>
        a URL of a server to fetch it.<br>
        You can fetch a placeholder<br>
        image to get an idea of how<br>
        a background image may look<br>
        on your site.
    </p>
    <h2>4. The CSS Box Model</h2>
    <p class="css-box-model-class">
        You can use the CSS Box Model for your styles.<br>
        Here is an example.<br>
        The CSS Box Model is essentially a box that<br>
        wraps around every CSS element.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Hyperlinks</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Hyperlinks, or links, are really what makes the web a network. The 
            html tag &lt;a&gt; specifies links and is short for anchor.
            Here is a relative link to a <a href="html_sample_2.html">second 
            page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also link to pages using the absolute path. For example, here 
            is <a href="https://sebastianzimmeck.de/class/comp333/comp333.html" 
            target="_blank">our class website</a>. Especially, in cases where you
            are leading the user away from your site it may be useful to open 
            the new page in a new tab using the HTML target property as we are 
            doing here. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another possiblity is to link to a particular id on a site, for 
            example, to the <a href="#white-div">div id above</a>. This type of 
            linking is called bookmarking. Use the pound sign in your href for 
            bookmarking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Links have different states. Originally, they are blue. But when you 
            clicked on a link, it will be in its visited state and will change 
            its color. You can also style links with CSS. However, apply styles 
            only in moderation to not confuse the user as to what is a link and 
            what not.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>6. Images</h2>
    <p>You can include images on your page as follows:</p>
    <img src="https://placeimg.com/400/200/any" alt="Here is the alt text.">
    <p>An alt text is useful to include, especially, if you are including 
        external images as we do here (these are placeholder images). If 
        the link breaks, you can describe to the user the image that was 
        supposed to be there:</p>
    <img src="http://sebastianzimmeck.de/doesnotexist.hmtl" alt="Here should be 
    an image but there is none, which is why you are seing this the broken image
    link icon and alt text."> Also, screen readers for the visually impaired can 
    read the alt text. So, even if there is no problem with loading images, it 
    is a good idea to include alt texts. Images can also be styled via CSS.
    <h2>7. Content Organization</h2>
    <h3 id="unordered-lists">7.1 Unordered Lists</h3>
    Here is an unordered list:
    <ul>
        <li>Here is the first item</li>
        <li>The second item</li>
        <li>And the third</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="ordered-lists">7.2 Ordered Lists</h3>
    Here is an ordered list (with roman numeral type):
    <!-- 
        With the type attribute you can change the number type.
     -->
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Here is the first ordered item</li>
        <li>The second ordered item</li>
        <li>And the third</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="descriptive-lists">7.3 Descriptive Lists</h3>
    Here is a descriptive list for descriptions
    (lists can also be nested):
    <dl>
        <dt>Here is the first descriptive item</dt>
        <dd>The second descriptive item</dd>
        <dd><ol>
            <li>First ordered list item</li>
            <li>Second ordered list item</li>
        </ol></dd>
    </dl>
    You can use a list to create a navigation bar.
    <a href="html_sample.html#navbar">Check it out.</a>
    <h3>7.4 Tables</h3>
    <p>Here is how you can create tables:</p>
    <table>
        <!-- 
            <tr> tag for a table row 
        -->
        <tr>
            <!-- 
                <th> tag for table header 
            -->
            <th>Band Name</th>
            <th>Music Style</th>
            <th>Origin</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <!-- 
                <td> tag for a table cell 
            -->
            <td>The Velvet Underground</td>
            <td>Punk</td>
            <td>New York, New York</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>The B-52s</td>
            <td>New Wave</td>
            <td>Athens, Georgia</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Joni Mitchell</td>
            <td>Folk</td>
            <td>Calgary, Canada</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>7.5 Navigation Bars</h3>
    <p>You can create your own navigation bar (navbar):</p>
    <div id="navbar" class="navbar">
        <ul>
            <li><a href="html_sample.html#unordered-lists">Unordered Lists</a></li>
            <li><a href="html_sample.html#ordered-lists">Ordered Lists</a></li>
            <li><a href="html_sample_2.html">Our Second Page</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Check the URL in your browser bar after you have clicked on Unordered
        Lists or Ordered Lists. You will see the specific # where you went. If 
        you click on Our Second Page the URL of that page will be shown.
    </p>
    <h2>8. HTML5 Page Structure Elements</h2>
    <p>HTML5 provides new tags to structure page content. 
    The new tags help developers structuring the page but have little impact on 
    users. Essentially, the new structure elements are replacing divs in a 
    lot of cases. You can now use semantic elements instead and style those to 
    also visually show the differences to the users.</p>
    <h3>8.1 Header</h3>
    &lt;header&gt; is intended for content at the top of a page, e.g., a 
    heading, banner image, or search box. Here is an example:
    <header><h1>Welcome to this page!</h1></header>
    <h3>8.2 Nav</h3>
    &lt;nav&gt; holds content of a navigation bar and can be included in the 
    header section.
    <h3>8.3 Article and Section</h3>
    &lt;article&gt; and &lt;section&gt; tags are good to use for publishers and 
    blog editors. Each article can begin and end with an article tag, and within
    the article there can be sections.
    <h3>8.4 Aside</h3>
    &lt;aside&gt; is intended for sidebar content, e.g., it can be associated 
    with an article or section but stands on its own, which is why it has its 
    own tags. It is a sidebar; maybe, with some additional related information.
    <h3>8.5 Footer</h3>
    &lt;footer&gt; holds the content at the bottom of the page, such as links to
    privacy policies, terms of services, or a navigation bar.
    <h2>9. Forms</h2>
    <p>You can use forms to have users submit data to you. Note that the email
        field verifies the email address format. The backend is missing here.
        We would need a database to receive the submitted data.</p>
    <!-- 
        Send data to html_sample_2.html.
    -->
    <form action="html_sample_2.html">
        <!-- 
            Ask for text input.
        -->
        <input type="text" name="first-name" value="Enter your first name">
        <input type="email" value="Enter your email">
        <!-- 
            You can have the user submitting data without showing it, which can
            be useful for a cookie value that you are passing in here, for 
            example. 
        -->
        <input type="hidden" name="hidden-field" value="pass-in-cookie-value-here">
        <!-- 
            Submit button 
        -->
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    <h2>10. iframes</h2>
    <p>An iframe (inline frame) can be used to embed your other pages, 
    videos, or content that you load from third party pages. For example, 
    here is an iframe embedding another page. It can be styled as usual in 
    the Style Sheet.</p>
    <iframe src="html_sample_2.html" name="navframe"></iframe>
    <!-- 
        This page does not require any JavaScript. The import of jQuery is just
        an example how a script can be imported (locally, i.e., not via a URL).
     -->
    <script src="js/jquery.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
